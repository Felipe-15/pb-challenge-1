## :pencil2: Description

It's a survey of an investment enterprise, with a few forms and steps, made with only HTML, CSS and TS/JS.

## :computer: How to run

To run the project correctly, you'll need to use some local server like `live server`, due the <strong>project uses es6 imports</strong>, it's only supported by http(s), so if you just directly open the index.html it will not execute the js scripts.

To make it easier I put a simple http-server package with a simple script, that way you can just run `npm i` and `npm start` at the root of the project and will execute normally in a port, do as you prefer.

## :boom: Problems Faced

In this project I tried to keep the most semantical HTML possibly, so any div's or span's that could be avoided I replaced with some tag more semantic.

So in cases like custom checkboxes, input radios, or select that are more easily to do with divs, I prefered to make a more complex CSS and maintain the semantic and simple HTML structure, which made me use more advanced tricks to balance visual, semantic and accessbility, and this was a very good challenge to improve my CSS skills.
